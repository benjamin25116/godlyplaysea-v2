   <h2>What is Godly Play?</h2>
   <p>Godly Play practice encourages children to listen for God and be authentic as well as creative in their response
    to
    God’s call on their lives. It is a creative and imaginative approach to Christian education and spiritual guidance.
    It
    also models elements of adult worship life such as: gathering together, praying, listening to stories as well as
    understanding symbols and participating in rituals of Christian congregations.

  <article>
   <p>Godly Play has its roots in the Montessori philosophy of child development. In Montessori, “follow the child” is
    the
    principle which guides the teacher’s activity with the child. The reason for this is because Montessori believes
    that
    every child has the innate desire to learn and discover truths about his environment through experience. And all
    this
    happens at his own pace; we cannot force a child to learn.

   <p>
    In Godly Play, the same principle applies. Godly Play believes that every child has thoughts and questions on things
    spiritual. A child desires to know and understand spirituality as a fact of the universe. Godly Play facilitates
    this by
    setting up an environment and process whereby children can play with stories in a meaningful way that leads to
    insight,
    thinking about the story and engaging with Scripture.

  <article>
   <p>
    With a foundation in Montessori and a history of over 40 years of research and practice, Godly Play allows children
    to
    make relevant and personal theological meaning. It values process, openness, discovery, community and relationships,
    and
    nurtures participants into a deeper dimension of belief and faith through wondering and play.
   </p>
   <p>
    Employing the Godly Play method will change the way you and your congregation interact with children. It is an
    amazing
    spiritual journey that is worth the time, energy, patience, and love.
